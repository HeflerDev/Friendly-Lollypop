## Getting Started

### How to Play

The game is hosted on heroku, so to play just click [here](https://bats-and-caves.herokuapp.com/dist/).

It features a platform turn-based game.
The game hud contains several items: The moves left, the Hp and the score counter.
Every move you do, including attack, use one of your moves, and only reset when the turn end. Every turn you end and enemy you kill,increment your score.
But beware: When you turn ends it's the enemy time to play.
Use WASD to move, if the character blink, means it was'nt wasted any move because it was invalid.
When near an enemy, SPACE to attack, and when there is no more moves, HOLD ENTER to end the turn.
